\usage{
integrateMM(
  minority,
  majority,
  metaDataRef,
  nModels,
  subtype,
  classColumn,
  higherClassColumn,
  crossValidation = T,
  integrate = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{minority}{R-object that contains the results from the Minority classifier}

\item{majority}{R-object that contains the results from the Majority classifier}

\item{metaDataRef}{Metadata file containing the links between the patients and
the tumor (sub)type diagnosis within the reference cohort.}

\item{nModels}{How many models were used to obtain a final prediction?}

\item{subtype}{Do you want to obtain the predictions on the tumor subtype classification level?
If so, use \emph{subtype = T}. If you want to obtain tumor type predictions instead, use \emph{subtype = F}.}

\item{classColumn}{Column name within metadata-file that contains the cancer subtype-labels.}

\item{higherClassColumn}{Column name within metadata-file that contains the cancer type labels.}

\item{crossValidation}{Specify whether the results are from the cross-validation setup or not.
This is important, as for the cross-validation setup there is a ground truth ($originalCall), while for new predictions there is not.}

\item{substituteNames}{Do you want to substitute some names?}

\item{substituteBy}{What do you want to substitute it by?}
}
\value{
If integrate = T: List containing the a dataframe with the final predictions (predictionsMMFinal),
and a list with the probability scores for all classification labels that were assigned to samples (MMProbabilityList).

predictionsMMFinal contains the top 3 final classification labels ($predict{2,3}) with their accompanying probability scores
($probability{1,2,3} and the original diagnosis label ($originalCall).

If integrate = F: List containing a dataframe with the final predictions separately for the Minority Classifier ($predictionsMinority)
and Majority Classifier ($predictionsMajority)
}
\description{
Function to obtain final predictions for the M&M algorithm by combining the results of the Minority & Majority classifiers.
