\title{Generate Models Minority Classifier}
\usage{
obtainModelsMinorityClassifier(
  dataTrain,
  samplesTrainDefList,
  nModels,
  ntree = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataTrain}{Data to be used for training, containing the whole reference cohort.}

\item{samplesTrainDefList}{List of different training data subsets used for the majority voting system.}

\item{nModels}{How many models should be created for the majority voting system?}

\item{ntree}{How many trees should we use during the weighted RF procedure?}
}
\value{
List containing the different Minority Classifier models to use for subsequent tumor (sub)type predictions.
}
\description{
Function to generated weighted Random Forest (RF) models to predict tumor (sub)type labels for new patient samples.
Each model is generated using a different subset of the training data, as specified in the \emph{samplesTrainDefList}.
