\item{classColumn}{Column in the metadata file that contains the tumor subtype labels.}

\item{higherClassColumn}{Column in the metadata file that contains the tumor type labels.}

\item{probabilityScoreTumor}{What is the probability score threshold you would like to use to call a classification 'confident' on the tumor type level?}

\item{probabilityScoreSubtype}{What is the probability score threshold you would like to use to call a classification 'confident' on the tumor subtype level?}

\item{throwOut}{Are there samples you would like to remove from the test set due to poor data quality? If so, add their rownames here.}
